# SEIR-model
We use the extended version of the SEIR model to study the evolution of the pandemic in two countries; Russia and Finland by employing curve-fitting techniques on obtained data of the epidemic evolution until the 12th June, 2021. We analyse the results to obtain parameters that govern the model. We also estimate the probability of amount of the population of the country that will be in need of critical care and also the probability of their fatalities.
